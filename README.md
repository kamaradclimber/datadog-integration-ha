# Datadog via API integration for Home Assistant

This integration is sending metrics and events from Home Assistant to Datadog.
As opposed to the official datadog integration, it contacts the datadog api directly, which removes the need to run a datadog agent along side HA.

The code is a fork of https://github.com/tjschiffer/hassio-addons ðŸ™‡.
